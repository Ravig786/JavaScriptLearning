What is Node.js ?

-> Javascript runtime (Not a language or a framework)
-> Built on the V8 Javascript engine (Same as Google Chrome)
-> Written in C++
-> Esentially allows us to run Javascript code on the server


Why use Nodejs ? 

-> Fast , efficient and highly scalable
-> Event driven , nonblocking I/O model
-> Popular in the industry
-> Same language on the front and back end (JS)

Non-blocking I/O
    - Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
    - Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections
    - Optimizes throughout & scalability in apps with many I/O operations
    - All of this makes Node.js apps very fast and efficient

Node's Event Loop
  - Single threaded
  - Supports concurrency via events & callbacks
  - EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners
